I am a PhD researcher in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the Dept. of Human Centred Design(https://hcd.iiitd.ac.in/), IIIT-Delhi. My research seeks to explore how to design technologies which allow older adults to meaningfully  explore the digital realm. I use both [coffee](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/397/types-of-coffee-drinks.html?srsltid=AfmBOopsN5QgxreTR_topPjgL4f6-sRyyqTyCD_kS8ZfZwrD4BpxRiPy), qualitative and quantitative methods in conducting my work. 

Other than work, I enjoy reading and learning about people, their languages and cultures. I like to travel and snap pictures when I am out and about in nature. Some of the `pictures` clicked earlier during my travels can be found hosted in my `Wordpress` [website](https://priyankarbhattacharjee.wordpress.com/photography/) which I had earlier created, but no longer update (Therefore, most sections do not reflect recent information about me). 

I am originally from `Shillong`, nestled in the beautiful hill state of Meghalaya in North Eastern India, and spent most of my childhood there. Later I completed my BE from Nagpur, before moving to US to complete my Masters at University of Nebraska, Lincoln, advised by [Tad Wysocki](https://engineering.unl.edu/person/tadeusz-wysocki/) and [Dale Tiller](https://engineering.unl.edu/person/dale-tiller/). If you are visiting Delhi and wish to discuss work, and/or just grab a meal or coffee together, please reach out (Online meets also work btw, although you are going to miss the awesome food that they have around this part of India).
