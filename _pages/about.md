I am a PhD researcher in Human Computer Interaction at the [AID Lab](https://aidlab.iiitd.edu.in/#about), IIIT-Delhi. My research seeks to explore how to design technologies which allow older adults to meaningfully  explore the digital realm. I use both [coffee](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/397/types-of-coffee-drinks.html?srsltid=AfmBOopsN5QgxreTR_topPjgL4f6-sRyyqTyCD_kS8ZfZwrD4BpxRiPy), qualitative and quantitative methods in conducting my work. 

Other than work, I enjoy reading and learning about people, cultures, and languages. I like to travel and snap pictures when I am out and about in nature. Some of the `pictures` clicked earlier during my travels can be found hosted in my `Wordpress` [website](https://priyankarbhattacharjee.wordpress.com/photography/) which I had earlier created, but no longer update (Most sections do not contain recent information).
