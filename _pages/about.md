I am a PhD researcher in Human-Computer Interaction `(HCI)` at the Dept. of Human Centred Design, IIIT-Delhi. My research seeks to explore how to design technologies which allow older adults to meaningfully  explore the digital realm. I use both qualitative and quantitative methods, plus lots of [coffee](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/397/types-of-coffee-drinks.html?srsltid=AfmBOopsN5QgxreTR_topPjgL4f6-sRyyqTyCD_kS8ZfZwrD4BpxRiPy) in conducting my work. 

Other than work, I enjoy reading and learning about people, their languages and cultures. I like to travel and snap pictures when I am out and about in nature. Some of the pictures clicked earlier during my travels can be found hosted in my `Wordpress` [website](https://priyankarbhattacharjee.wordpress.com/photography/) which I had earlier created, but no longer update (Therefore, most sections do not reflect recent information about me). 

I am originally from `Shillong`, nestled in the beautiful hill state of Meghalaya in North Eastern India, and spent most of my childhood there. Later I completed my BE from Nagpur, before moving to US to complete my Masters at University of Nebraska, Lincoln, advised by [Tad Wysocki](https://engineering.unl.edu/person/tadeusz-wysocki/) and [Dale Tiller](https://engineering.unl.edu/person/dale-tiller/). If you are visiting Delhi and wish to discuss work, and/or just grab a meal or coffee together, please reach out (Online meets are also fine, although in that case you are going to miss out on the terrific food scene here in NCR).

Btw, if you are wondering about the picture, it was clicked by my 8 year old in Manali when she was trying to photograph the Himalayas, and I just accidentally happened to wander into the frame.
