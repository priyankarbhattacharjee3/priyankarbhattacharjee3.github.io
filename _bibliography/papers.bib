  abstract          = {Modern society is characterized by the use of information and communication technologies. Older adults are believed to face challenges while learning to use new technologies but there is very limited understanding of what those challenges are or how they should be overcome. In this paper, we present findings from a literature review of 22 articles conducted to a) identify challenges that older adults face learning digital skills, and b) understand older adults’ reactions in response to learning challenges. The findings indicate that older adults mainly face five types of challenges in learning digital skills: 1) age-related barriers, 2) problems related to technology features or design, 3) perceptions of low self-efficacy, 4) negative societal attitude, and 5) complexity of training materials. The findings also indicate that facing and trying to overcome the challenges result in negative emotions like fear and anxiety which are detrimental to gaining confidence in technology use. We identify opportunities to improve digital skills training so that older adults can benefit from confident use of new technology.},

  abstract          = {A country's biggest asset is its workforce, given the fact that a healthy workforce can contribute to rapid growth of the economy. Chronic illnesses reduce productivity, are responsible for rising healthcare costs, and should be managed by the employer to reduce healthcare expenditures. This can be done through employee health and wellness programs, and well-designed health management initiatives. In addition, new information and communication technologies make it possible to monitor employee health with wearable devices and tele-health assisted surveillance techniques. This paper introduces a unique new approach to workplace healthcare monitoring, using the office workstation PC itself to monitor worker health. The main benefits are: reduction in the number of visits to the doctor during office hours; reduced dependency on institutionalized health setting such as hospitals for check-ups; and prior knowledge of worsening symptoms, thereby leading to timely cure rather than last minute hospital visits, nursing home admissions, all of which result in lesser sick leaves, and more productivity per employee.},

  abstract          = {Missed appointments or patient no-shows cause the government a lot of money in the form of financial losses each year, and [are] responsible for rising costs of medical care, in both urgent and primary settings. Reminder systems that inform patients of upcoming appointments, or probabilistic algorithms that pre-determine chances of 'no-show' are some of the techniques, currently implemented to minimize the ill effect of no-shows. This paper discusses a novel approach by which the patient’s health status is a click away from the doctor or care-giver, and as a result the need for regular clinical visits is minimized.},
